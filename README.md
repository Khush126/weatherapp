# Weather Application for Python Internship

This is a simple command-line Python application that retrieves and displays weather information for a given city. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather conditions.

## Installation

Before running the application, you need to install the required Python package:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
python weather_app.py
```
When the application runs smoothly, enter the name of the city you want to get the weather for.

## API Key
The application requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap. I signed up on OpenWeatherMap and created API key to use for this assignment.

## Error Handling
The application includes basic error handling. If an error occurs while retrieving the weather data, the application will print an error message and continue running.
